# Hi there 👋

I'm Adam, a JavaScript and TypeScript virtuoso who crafts captivating experiences with front end technologies.

When I'm not immersed in the digital realm as a student at Poznan University of Technology, you'll find me capturing life's moments through the lens or in the company of my feline friends.

Join me in this symphony of innovation, where every keystroke is a note of creativity, and together, we'll waltz through the wonderful world of code, cats, and creativity! 🚀🐱🎨
