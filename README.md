# Hi there, I'm Adam 👋

🚀 Hey there! I'm a Front-End Dev with 3+ years of experience. Worked on cool stuff for hospitals (HSS) and companies like Fingoweb and Trol.<br />
💻 Fluent in the language of web development, whether it's TypeScript, React, Next.js, Vue, or any other tech du jour. Always riding the wave of new trends. <br/>
📚 Constantly learning, geeking out on tech. Also, cooking up personal projects like [Emotion 98.3](https://emotion.miami/) and adding flair to local events like Drugie Życie. Check out my creations at [adamjalocha.pl](https://www.adamjalocha.pl/)!
